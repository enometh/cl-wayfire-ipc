;; This file is loaded before all other protocols, as other protocols are
;; dependent on wayland core types (such as wl-output, wl-buffer, etc).
;; Separating them out by file prevents symbol conflicts, since evaluating
;; (export ...) at exec-time generated by WL-INCLUDE happens after interning
;; symbols at macro-expansion time.
