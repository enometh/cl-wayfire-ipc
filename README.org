* wayflan-ext

wayfan-ext extends wayflan https://git.sr.ht/~shunter/wayflan/ in
certain ways.  It does not use asdf.  The non-protocol spec portions
of wayflan/common and wayfan-client systems factored out for
reuse. (wayflan-alt.system). this is then used to to generate lisp
source files on disk which implement protocols (rather than expanding
the macros in memory). wayflan package names are renamed to be
friendlier for the debugger. examples that wrap up extensions are
included.
